## Overview
We will be working with Students’ Academic Performance Dataset, obtained from kaggle.com. The dataset is an educational data set which is collected from learning management system (LMS) called Kalboard 360. Kalboard 360 is a multi-agent LMS, which has been designed to facilitate learning through the use of leading-edge technology. The data is collected using a learner activity tracker tool, which called experience API (xAPI). The xAPI is a component of the training and learning architecture (TLA) that enables to monitor learning progress and learner’s actions like reading an article or watching a training video. There are multiple audiences that would be interested in using this dataset.

## Technical Description

## Questions
1. What kinds of academic behavior leads to enhancing grade of students?
2. Does a specific gender tend to be more influenced by the academic behaviors?
3. Students from which nation tend to achieve highest average academic performance?
4. How does having higher participation affect on achieving better academic performance in each nation?
